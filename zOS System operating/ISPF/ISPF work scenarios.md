## How to display/modify data set profile

1. To display the ```profile``` of a dataset, in a frame with any section of that dataset in edit mode (```E```):
```Command ===> PROF```

2. To change the ```profile``` of a dataset, in a frame with any section of that dataset in edit mode (```E```):

      2.1. Display the ```profile``` of a dataset:
      ```Command ===> PROF```

      As a result of executing this command, you get, for example:
      ```
      ....MODELS (FIXED - **80**)....RECOVERY **ON**....NUMBER **OFF**.............

      ....HILITE **BOOK** CURSOR **FIND**......................................
      ```
      2.2. If you want to change the value of any parameter to the opposite; e.g. remove section statistics     
      including id:
      ```Command ===> STATS OFF```


## ```userid``` in data sets names

1. If the dataset is not enclosed in apostrophes (```dsname```), a prefix is automatically added to the dataset name:
```userid.dsname```

2. If a dataset is enclosed in apostrophes (```‘dsname’```), the dataset name is not changed:
```dsname```

 
## How to edit ```‘userid.SUPERC.LIST’```

* Performed in data set edit mode (```E```).
* It's performed on the entire data set or in the range from ```".A"``` to ```".B"```, specified in the column with line numbers.

1. Set border on all text:
```Command ===> BOUNDS 1 133```

**NOTES:**
You can check the border by setting in the column with line numbers ```BNDS```

2. Exclude all text from being displayed (blank screen):
```Command ===> EX ALL [.A .B]```

3. Show change lines:

```Command ===> F 'I -' 2 4 ALL```

```Command ===> F 'D -' 2 4 ALL```

```Command ===> F 'RN-' 2 4 ALL```

```Command ===> F 'RO-' 2 4 ALL```

4. Remove all not displayed rows from a dataset:
```Command ===> DEL ALL X```

**NOTES:**
To remove displayed rows from a dataset:
```Command ===> DEL ALL NX```.
To restore the display of the original dataset (before it was saved):
```Command ===> RES EX```

5. Empty 8 positions can be deleted:

      5.1. Set border of movable text:

      ```Command ===> BOUNDS 1 133```

6. View in ```B``` mode.


## How to restore deleted data set
```
=> hlist 'USER00.work' both
=> hlist da'USER00.work' both
=> hrecover 'USER00.work' generation(0) newname('USER00.work.#031106')
```

 
## Save information about list of data sets and partitions list of data sets

1. Information about the list of data sets can be viewed by pressing ```F11``` in the frame with the list of data sets:
```
Message           Volume
Tracks %Used XT  Device
Dsorg  Recfm  Lrecl  Blksz
Tracks %   XT Device  Dsorg Recfm Lrecl Blksz  Created    Expires    Referred
         Catalog 
```

2. Information about the list of partitions in the data set can be viewed by pressing ```F11``` in the frame with the list of partitions:
```
Name     Prompt       Size   Created          Changed          ID
Name     Prompt       Size    Init     Mod      VV MM          ID
```

3. To store information about a dataset list, in a frame with a dataset list:
```Command ===> SAVE name   (any name)```

The information is stored in ```‘userid.name.DATASETS’```, 

4. To save information about a dataset partitions list:

      4.1. Specify dataset edit mode (```E```)

      4.2. In the frame with the list of sections:
      ```Command ===> SAVE name   (any name)```

      The information is stored in ‘userid.name.MEMBERS’, for example:
      ```
      #CPPSH                 01.57 05/06/13 04:24    93    92     0 USER00
      #EXPSH                 01.62 05/06/13 04:13   109   131     0 USER00
      @HFS                   01.99 05/05/30 08:04   250    29     0 USER00
      DDLIST                 01.56 05/04/11 04:34   167    93     0 USER00
      . . .
      ```


## How to save ISPF screen image in dataset ‘userid.SPFn.LIST’

1.	If there is no dataset ```‘userid.SPFn.LIST’``` (n=0-9), create it:

      1.1. In the main menu:
      ```OPTION ==> 3.2```

      1.2. In the frame ```DATA SET UTILITY```:
      ```
      OPTION ==> A
           DATA SET NAME ===> 'userid.SPFn.LIST'
      ```

      1.3. In the frame ```ALLOCATE NEW DATA SET```:
      ```
      ...
      PRIMARY QUANTITY   ===> 240
      SECONDARY QUANTITY ===> 462
      DIRECTORY BLOCKS   ===> 0
      RECORD FORMAT      ===> FBA
      RECORD LENGTH      ===> 121
      BLOCK SIZE         ===> 3146
      ```

2. Collect data by sequentially executing for each displayed screen:
```Command ===> PRINT```

3. Output prepared data to dataset ```‘userid.SPFn.LIST’```:

      3.1. In the last displayed frame after ```PRINT```:
      ```Command ===> LIST```

      3.2. In the frame ```Specify Disposition of List Data Set```:
      ```
      List Data Set (userid.SPFn.LIST) Disposition:
           Process option . . . 3
      ```

4. To output the ISPF displays image to the next dataset ```‘userid.SPFn.LIST’``` repeat steps 2 - 3.

**NOTES:**
Next dataset – ```‘userid.SPFx.LIST’:```
                              ```(x - n+1, n+2, ... 9, 0, 1, 2, ...)```
